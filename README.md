# 🚀 Data Warehouse & Analytics Learning Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Learning Project**!
I’m currently learning how to design and build a complete data warehousing solution — from storing raw data to creating useful reports and insights.

This project is part of my **portfolio**, and it’s helping me practice **industry best practices** in data engineering and analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture (Medallion Layers)

I’m using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to organize the data:

* **Bronze Layer** → Stores **raw data** as-is from source systems. (Here, I’m loading CSV files into a SQL Server database).
* **Silver Layer** → Cleans, standardizes, and prepares the data so it’s ready for analysis.
* **Gold Layer** → Contains **business-ready data** in a **star schema** that’s optimized for reporting and dashboards.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

* **Data Architecture** → Designing a modern warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
* **ETL Pipelines** → Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
* **Data Modeling** → Creating fact and dimension tables for analytics.
* **Analytics & Reporting** → Writing SQL queries and building dashboards for insights.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning & Practicing

Through this project, I’m practicing skills that are important for roles such as:

* SQL Developer
* Data Engineer
* ETL Developer
* Data Modeler
* Data Analyst
